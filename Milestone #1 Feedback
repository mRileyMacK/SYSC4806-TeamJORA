Create a simple prototype that is always working, start from bare bones and build up

Final UI should be black and white thyme leaf, DO NOT use react

Need Unit and Integration tests (API tests) 
•	Mock MVC 
•	Test models, views, and controllers

Could create ItemList as an entity in the DB, no need to have it separately

One person create the api for adding the student
•	That person tests the front end, back end, etc… does the slice, not a specialist

All members should be contributing to Pull Requests

More even commits, and contributions,
